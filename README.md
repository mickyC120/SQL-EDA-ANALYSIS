# üßÆ SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üß† Background & Business Context
This project showcases a series of **SQL-based exploratory data analyses** performed on datasets sourced from a simulated business data warehouse.  
It reflects the typical workflow of a **Business Intelligence Analyst**, exploring raw data to uncover trends, segment performance, and generate actionable insights for reporting and strategy.

The project is built using **PostgreSQL** and demonstrates practical query design across multiple business domains ‚Äî from sales and customer analytics to operational KPIs and cumulative reporting.

---

## üéØ Objective
To perform structured SQL-based exploration and develop analytical scripts that help:
- Understand data structures and key metrics within a warehouse environment.  
- Uncover patterns in sales, customer behavior, and time-based performance.  
- Create reusable SQL snippets that accelerate analytical reporting and dashboard preparation.  
- Simulate the hands-on work of a BI professional exploring live data for insights.

## üíº Business Value
This repository mirrors how data teams deliver value using SQL:
- **Faster Decision-Making:** Pre-built analytical queries reduce time to insight.  
- **Standardized EDA Approach:** Ensures consistent and repeatable exploration workflows.  
- **Scalable Insights:** Enables analysts to extend the queries for dashboard and KPI reporting.  
- **Cross-Domain Usability:** Each script can be adapted for multiple business contexts (sales, HR, finance, marketing, etc.).

## üß© Example Insights

Here are examples of insights the scripts are designed to reveal:
- Identify **top-performing regions or customer segments** based on revenue.  
- Track **monthly growth trends** and detect seasonal performance shifts.  
- Segment customers by **recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM)** behavior.  
- Compare **year-over-year metrics** to evaluate long-term performance.  
- Measure **churn and retention** patterns for customer lifecycle analysis.

## üîó Repository Purpose
This project serves as a **reference library** for SQL analytical workflows.  
#### üôå Acknowledgment
This project was inspired by an educational SQL walkthrough by **DataWithBarra** on YouTube.  
I followed along and implemented the scripts independently to deepen my understanding of SQL analytics workflows and business data exploration.
